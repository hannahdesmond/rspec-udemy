### RSpec Udemy Course

## Why I am taking this course?
I am taking the Udemy RSpec course to help me to develop a solid foundation in TDD and RSpec. I want to be able to expalin TDD, and how to use the  describe, it, expect and eq methods, how to read failures and make specs pass, and reducing duplication, with the aim of learning how to design and develop software with a test-first approach.
